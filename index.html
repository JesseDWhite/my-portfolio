          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>
            I was born in Portland Oregon in 1993 and have been living here my whole life. I attended Arts and
            Communications
            Magnet Academy for highschool and graduated in 2012. After my time in highschool was over, I took a gap year
            to
            travel and gain new life experiences through AmeriCorps NCCC. This is a program that takes individuals from
            accross the United States and places them in teams of 10 to fulfill community service projects where need is
            apparent. I met my now wife of over a year in the program and have never been happier. During this time my
            team
            and I were placed at the following projects:
          <ul>
            <li>5 weeks of disaster relief in New York City, aiding survivors of Superstorm Sandy</li>
            <li>11 weeks of camping in Agua Caliente inside the Anza Borrego desert, working to preserve six natural hot
              springs that serve as the water source for the desert town</li>
            <li> 8 weeks of infrastructure improvements in Washington State at YMCA Camp Bishop and Huston Camp and
              Conference
              Center</li>
            <li> 6 weeks working as a camp counselor for adults and children with special needs and disabilities at
              Easter
              Seals
              Camp Harmon</li>
          </ul>

        <h2>Reason for Persuing Coding</h2>
        <p>I was a Director of Operations of a small to medium business in Portland. I was onboarded early on and
          implemented
          most, if not all policies and procedures. I did a small amount of coding and project management at my previous
          job
          as well as work with the City of Portlandâ€™s Dev-Team on developing a new internal application. I also took a
          class
          in intermediate Excel and that sort of became my gateway drug to coding.</p>
        <p>
          However, I abruptly left my job due to a moral obligation to myself and the rest of my future career. I always
          loved and looked forward to the times in my job I got to work on applications and with the dev-team and
          thought
          that now would be a good time for a career shift. I knew a few previous students of Epicodus that always spoke
          highly of it and recommended that I attend. I had a two-month break between Epicodus and when I left my job,
          so
          I
          took an online bootcamp through Udemy.com to get more familiar with the syntax. I finished the bootcamp on the
          Sunday before class at Epicodus started and now I am here. <a href="resume.html">Here is a link to my full
