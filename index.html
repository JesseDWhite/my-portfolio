    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <h3>Thank you for coming to my page. Here is a brief description of me and my drives. </h3>
    <p>
      I was born in Portland Oregon in 1993 and have been living here my whole life. I attended Arts and Communications
      Magnet Academy for highschool and graduated in 2012. After my time in highschool was over, I took a gap year to
      travel and gain new life experiences through AmeriCorps NCCC. This is a program that takes individuals from
      accross the United States and places them in teams of 10 to fulfill community service projects where need is
      apparent. During this time my team and I were placed at the following projects:
    <ul>
      <li>5 weeks of disaster relief in New York City, aiding survivors of Superstorm Sandy</li>
      <li>11 weeks of camping in Agua Caliente inside the Anza Borrego desert, working to preserve six natural hot
        springs that serve as the water source for the desert town</li>
      <li> 8 weeks of infrastructure improvements in Washington State at YMCA Camp Bishop and Huston Camp and Conference
        Center</li>
      <li> 6 weeks working as a camp counselor for adults and children with special needs and disabilities at Easter
        Seals
        Camp Harmon</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      In 2019, I married my longtime partner, Katherine and have never been happier.
