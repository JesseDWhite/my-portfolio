          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>
            Growing up, whenever I was asked what I wanted to be when I grew up, I always said, “to be either a scientist and an inventor”. Now those are two extremely vague job titles for a
            10-year-old to wrap their head around, but I was insistent on that. I did not know what I would specialize in as a scientist, or even any great ideas to become the inventor of. Once I got
            older and more experience in life, I assumed that both of those aspirations were out of touch and un-achievable. However, I was given an opportunity to act as Director of Operations for a
            small to medium size business in 2017. This helped me realize that my original aspirations were not too off base and that I just needed to define what it meant to be a scientist and an
            inventor.
          </p>
          <p>
            Through my experience as a Director of Operations, I learned what it truly meant to run a business and the subtle intricacies of staff dynamic, workplace culture, and the importance of
            tech in any field. My very first task at this new position was to get everything they were currently using for workflow to a digital form. The business at the time did not have much money
            since all profits were going back into base operating functions, so these solutions needed to be made from scratch and in-house. After a lot of trial and error I was able to piece together
            multiple web-based applications that digitized all timesheets, employee information and tracking, job orders and general workflow, and much more. Through this success, I realized that I
            was not too far off my childhood goal of inventing and becoming a scientist.
          </p>
          I was later given an opportunity to leave my job and pursue what I found along the way; coding and web-based application development. Coding allowed me to take an idea that I had and put
          it into a physical form, even if it is just a basic calculator. This fulfilled my desire to invent. It also allowed me to try different ideas and theories for applying an idea to a through
          trial and error. This then fulfilled my aspiration of becoming a scientist even if not directly.
          <p>
            My biggest take away so far, is that your childhood aspirations may not go away, but simply show up in different ways. I was lucky enough to find mine through business operations and
            coding. I love being able to put some text into a code editor and see it come to life on a computer, phone, or even a TV. It feels like magic every time I do it. I am currently learning
            HTML, CSS, JavaScript, C#, React, and .NET and am sure that my love of creating will continue to grow through coding and web-development.

          <h2>Reason for Persuing Coding</h2>
          <p>I was a Director of Operations of a small to medium business in Portland. I was onboarded early on and
            implemented
            most, if not all policies and procedures. I did a small amount of coding and project management at my
            previous
            job
            as well as work with the City of Portland’s Dev-Team on developing a new internal application. I also took a
            class
            in intermediate Excel and that sort of became my gateway drug to coding.</p>
          <p>
            However, I abruptly left my job due to a moral obligation to myself and the rest of my future career. I
            always
            loved and looked forward to the times in my job I got to work on applications and with the dev-team and
            thought
            that now would be a good time for a career shift. I knew a few previous students of Epicodus that always
            spoke
            highly of it and recommended that I attend. I had a two-month break between Epicodus and when I left my job,
            so
            I
            took an online bootcamp through Udemy.com to get more familiar with the syntax. I finished the bootcamp on
            the
            Sunday before class at Epicodus started and now I am here.

                My brother and I have both picked up snowboarding as a hobby this year. Neither of us have been
                snowboarding
                since we were children. While I had some free time before school started, him and I would try and go
                every
                weekend this season.

                Growing up in Oregon meant that my family was big into camping.When I was young, we would go camping
                upwards
                of five to ten times a year to varying different areas. As an adult, I try to go as much as I can with
                my
                dad, but life has a way of making getting out difficult.

                Simillar to camping, my father and I will try and make it out backpcking whenever we can. Our last trip
                was
                a three day excursion around Waldo Lake in Central Oregon. We covered approximatley 20 miles of trail
                during
                our time there and stayed at an established campground at the end of the journey.
