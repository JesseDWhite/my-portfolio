          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>
            I was born in Portland Oregon in 1993 and have been living here my whole life. I attended Arts and
            Communications
            Magnet Academy for highschool and graduated in 2012. After my time in highschool was over, I took a gap year
            to
            travel and gain new life experiences through AmeriCorps NCCC. This is a program that takes individuals from
            accross the United States and places them in teams of 10 to fulfill community service projects where need is
            apparent. I met my now wife of over a year in the program and have never been happier. During this time my
            team
            and I were placed at the following projects:
          <ul>
            <li>5 weeks of disaster relief in New York City, aiding survivors of Superstorm Sandy</li>
            <li>11 weeks of camping in Agua Caliente inside the Anza Borrego desert, working to preserve six natural hot
              springs that serve as the water source for the desert town</li>
            <li> 8 weeks of infrastructure improvements in Washington State at YMCA Camp Bishop and Huston Camp and
              Conference
              Center</li>
            <li> 6 weeks working as a camp counselor for adults and children with special needs and disabilities at
              Easter
              Seals
              Camp Harmon</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Reason for Persuing Coding</h2>
          <p>I was a Director of Operations of a small to medium business in Portland. I was onboarded early on and
            implemented
            most, if not all policies and procedures. I did a small amount of coding and project management at my
            previous
            job
            as well as work with the City of Portlandâ€™s Dev-Team on developing a new internal application. I also took a
            class
            in intermediate Excel and that sort of became my gateway drug to coding.</p>
          <p>
            However, I abruptly left my job due to a moral obligation to myself and the rest of my future career. I
            always
            loved and looked forward to the times in my job I got to work on applications and with the dev-team and
            thought
            that now would be a good time for a career shift. I knew a few previous students of Epicodus that always
            spoke
            highly of it and recommended that I attend. I had a two-month break between Epicodus and when I left my job,
            so
            I
            took an online bootcamp through Udemy.com to get more familiar with the syntax. I finished the bootcamp on
            the
            Sunday before class at Epicodus started and now I am here.

            My brother and I have both picked up snowboarding as a hobby this year. Neither of us have been snowboarding
            since we were children. While I had some free time before school started, him and I would try and go every
            weekend this season.

            <h2>Music</h2>
            I have been playing music since I was in middle school. I started with the alto saxaphone and switched to
            guiter in highschool. I played in a few different bands during that time and now enjoy the recording process
            of music.

            <h2>Camping</h2>
            Growing up in Oregon meant that my family was big into camping when I was young. We would go camping upwards
            of five to ten times a year to varying different areas. As an adult, I try to go as much as I can with my
            dad, but life has a way of making getting out difficult.

            <h2>Backpacking</h2>
            Simillar to camping, my father and I will try and make it out backpcking whenever we can. Our last trip was
            a three day excursion around Waldo Lake in Central Oregon. We covered approximatley 20 miles of trail during
            our time there and stayed at an established campground at the end of the journy.
